_Virtual Clicker_ is a student response system built for my high school calculus class as a replacement to a traditional iClicker&trade; system. It allows more modes of responses, including simple numerical answers, longer written answers, LaTeX, and multiple choice.

Students can use a WYSIWYG editor to input LaTeX or if they prefer, a large pallete of mathematical symbols, complete with predictive typing and keyboard shortcuts. Previous responses are conveniently saved for later reference _Virtual Clicker_ also includes a multitude of themes, and a custom theme creator.
